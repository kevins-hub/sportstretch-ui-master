          acknowledge that Treatments obtained through the Service in all
          likelihood will not be covered services under your benefit plan, the
          Medicare program, a state Medicaid program, or any health insurance

          plan, the Medicare program, a state Medicaid program, or any health
          insurance plan whether government-sponsored or private, although

          SPORTSTRETCH will have no liability in connection with your ability to
          secure reimbursement for any such Medical Treatment. You acknowledge
          and agree that SPORTSTRETCH will not file any claims with your
          insurance benefit plan, the Medicare program, a state Medicaid
          program, or any other third party medical benefits program, and that
          the services you receive from or through SPORTSTRETCH may not be
          eligible for reimbursement under such plans. You acknowledge,
          understand and agree that when using the Service, you may be

          g. Dispute Resolution. Although SPORTSTRETCH retains the right to
          mediate any dispute between you and a Provider or a Recovery

        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides
          recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on
          the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you
          believe in good faith that materials hosted by SPORTSTRETCH infringe
          your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting
          that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must
          include the following information:
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          a. a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
          behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          b. identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
          infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Service are

        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          c. identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or
          the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably
          sufficient to allow SPORTSTRETCH to locate the material on the
          Service;
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          d. the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if
          available) of the complaining party;
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          e. a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that
          use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by
          the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          f. a statement that the information in the notification is accurate,

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement
          has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send
          SPORTSTRETCH a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet
          the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see
          www.copyright.gov for details. Notices and counter-notices with
          respect to the Service should be sent to Janice Bader, Symbus Law
          Group, P.O. Box 933, Culpeper, Virginia 22701, or by email at
          jbader@symbus.com with the subject line "SPORTSTRETCH DMCA Notice" or
          "SPORTSTRETCH DMCA Counter-notice" as applicable. We suggest that you
          consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.

          DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR
          USE OF THE SERVICE. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a
          judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is
          subject to very limited review by courts. Please visit www.adr.org for
          more information about arbitration.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          i. Commencing Arbitration. A party seeking arbitration must first send

          arbitrate (a "Notice"), or, in the absence of a mailing address
          provided by you to SPORTSTRETCH, to you via any other method available
          to SPORTSTRETCH, including via e-mail. The Notice to SPORTSTRETCH
          should be addressed to SPORTSTRETCH Networks, Inc., P.O. Box 5191, New
          York, NY 10185-5191, Attn: Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel
          or legal@SPORTSTRETCH.com (the "Address"). The Notice must (A)
          describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (B) set
          forth the specific relief sought (the "Demand"). If the claim is not
          resolved within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or
          SPORTSTRETCH may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below
          or file a claim in small claims court. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE
          ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") IN
          ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY
          PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE "Rules"), AS MODIFIED BY
          THESE TERMS. The Rules and AAA forms are available at www.adr.org. If
          you are required to pay a filing fee to commence arbitration against
          SPORTSTRETCH, then SPORTSTRETCH will promptly reimburse you for your

          Notice at the Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a

          ii. Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration will be in English. A
          single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary
          place of business in New York County, New York, will be appointed
          pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and SPORTSTRETCH agree
          to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline
          the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the
          parties: (A) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online
          and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to
          be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (B) the arbitration
          will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
          unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (C)
          any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in
          any court of competent jurisdiction.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          iii. No Class Actions. YOU AND SPORTSTRETCH AGREE THAT YOU AND
          SPORTSTRETCH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS
          INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
          PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT
          THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE
          PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
          REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO
          IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THIS ENTIRE MANDATORY ARBITRATION
          SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          iv. Decision of the Arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances,
          the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the
          date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this
          deadline by 30 days in the interests of justice. Arbitration
          proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all
          related records will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to
          obtain court confirmation of the award. The award will be in writing
          and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the claim's
          disposition. The arbitrator will apply New York state law during the
          arbitration. You agree that these terms and your use of the App
          evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United
          States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation,
          enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration
          clause in These Terms. If the dispute is finally resolved through
          arbitration in your favor, SPORTSTRETCH will pay you the highest of
          the following: (A) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (B)
          the last written settlement amount offered by SPORTSTRETCH in
          settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (C)
          $1,000.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          b. Equitable Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 21 do
          not apply to any claim in which SPORTSTRETCH seeks equitable relief of
          any kind. You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of these
          Terms by SPORTSTRETCH or any third party, the damage or harm, if any,
          caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other
          equitable relief against SPORTSTRETCH, and your only remedy will be
          for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set
          forth above.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          c. Claims. You and SPORTSTRETCH agree that, notwithstanding any other
          rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action
          arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service, excluding a
          claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the
          cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is
          permanently barred.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          d. Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against SPORTSTRETCH
          must be resolved in accordance with this Section 21. All claims filed
          or brought contrary to this Section 21 will be considered improperly
          filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section 21,
          SPORTSTRETCH may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to $5,000,
          provided that SPORTSTRETCH has notified you in writing of the
          improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the
          claim.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          e. Modifications. If SPORTSTRETCH changes the Mandatory Arbitration
          provision (other than a change to SPORTSTRETCH's Address), then you
          may reject any such change by sending us written notice to
          SPORTSTRETCH's Address within 30 days of the change, in which case
          your Account and your right to use the Service will terminate
          immediately, and this Section 21, as in effect immediately prior to
          the amendments you reject, will survive termination of these Terms.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          f. Enforceability. If only Section 21.a.iii or the entirety of this
          Section 21 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this
          Section 21 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree
          that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 22 will
          govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          The laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of law
          rules, govern these Terms and your use of the Service. Your use of the

          international laws; provided, however, that the United Nations
          Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not
          apply to any provision of these Terms. To the extent that any action
          relating to any dispute hereunder is permitted to be brought in a
          court of law, such action will be subject to the exclusive
          jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York
          County, New York and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal
          jurisdiction in such courts, and waive any defense of inconvenient

          the content thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any
          maintenance and support services with respect to the Service. In the
          event of any failure of the Service to conform to any applicable
          warranty, then you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase
          price for the relevant Service to you; and, to the maximum extent
          permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation
          whatsoever with respect to the Service. Apple is not responsible for
